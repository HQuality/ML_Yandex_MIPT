Thanks for opening an issue!

Please include as much detail as possible: what does your dataset look like, what hyperparameters you are using (and have you tried other ones?).

When including code snippets, make sure you use appropriate code formatting using backtics. Have a look at the markdown reference for details: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/.
